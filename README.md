## Description

The **GamingStation** project is a fun and interactive game station that allows users to play two simple games:

### 1. **Tic Tac Toe**:
   - A classic 3x3 grid game where two players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' on the grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

### 2. **Quiz Game**:
   - A multiple-choice quiz where users are asked questions and can select one of the four options. The game tracks your score as you go through each question.
